<p>COPUS is a protocol developed by Michelle Smith, Francis Jones, Sarah Gilbert, and Carl Wieman to observe and record the activities that occur in a classroom. More details can be found at <a href="http://www.cwsei.ubc.ca/resources/COPUS.htm">Carl Wieman Science Initiative at the University of British Columbia</a>. The original paper, guidelines, and training materials can be found at their <a href="http://www.cwsei.ubc.ca/resources/COPUS.htm">site</a>. Some examples of how to use the observation data is given as well.</p>

<p>This app is used to aid in implementing an observation based on the COPUS protocol. The options on the opening view allow you to choose the different options from the protocol. The basic idea is that you start the timer, record the observations, and stop the timer at the end. You then send the results via email so that you can view and share them.</p>
<p>Before starting the timer a second time you have to send the previous observations so that the observations can be saved. Otherwise, the previous observations will be lost. </p>
<p>How to operate:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Click the start button to begin the timer.</li>
  <li>While the timer is on touch the checkboxes coresponding to the activities you observe.</li>
  <li>Every two minutes the checkboxes are saved, cleared, and the cycle starts over.</li>
  <li>At the end of the class period touch the stop button.</li>
  <li>Touch the email icon at the bottom of the screen, and the results will be attached to an email.</li>
  <li>Send the results to yourself or someone else, and they can be downloaded onto another computer and analyzed.</li>
</ol>
<p>More information about the protocol is available at <a href="http://www.cwsei.ubc.ca/resources/COPUS.htm">Carl Wieman Science Initiative at the University of British Columbia</a>.</p>
<p>There is one difference in the app and the protocol. This app allows you to specify student engagements for each student status. If you do not like this simply use the top student engagement level and ignore the others.</p>
